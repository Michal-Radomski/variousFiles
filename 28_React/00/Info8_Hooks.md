Yes, you can define React hooks in a `.ts` file, but there are important considerations regarding their usage and context.

### **Key Points**

1. **File Extensions**:

   - A `.ts` file is meant for TypeScript code that does not include JSX (JavaScript XML). If your hook does not use any JSX
     (for instance, if it only contains TypeScript logic or functions), it can be placed in a `.ts` file.
   - If your hook includes JSX (for example, when returning a component or using React elements), it must be in a `.tsx`
     file, which is specifically for TypeScript files that contain JSX syntax.

2. **Usage Context**:

   - Hooks are designed to be used within functional components. They cannot be used inside class components or outside of
     React components altogether.
   - You can create custom hooks in a `.ts` file and then import them into your functional components defined in `.tsx`
     files.

3. **Example of a Hook in a `.ts` File**: Here's an example of how you might define a simple custom hook in a `.ts` file:

   ```typescript
   // useCounter.ts
   import { useState } from "react";

   const useCounter = (initialValue: number = 0) => {
     const [count, setCount] = useState(initialValue);

     const increment = () => setCount(count + 1);
     const decrement = () => setCount(count - 1);

     return { count, increment, decrement };
   };

   export default useCounter;
   ```

4. **Importing the Hook**: You would then import and use this hook in a component defined in a `.tsx` file:

   ```typescript
   // CounterComponent.tsx
   import React from "react";
   import useCounter from "./useCounter";

   const CounterComponent: React.FC = () => {
     const { count, increment, decrement } = useCounter();

     return (
       <div>
         <h1>{count}</h1>
         <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
         <button onClick={decrement}>Decrement</button>
       </div>
     );
   };

   export default CounterComponent;
   ```

### **Conclusion**

In summary, while you can define custom hooks in `.ts` files as long as they do not contain JSX, you must use them within
functional components that are defined in `.tsx` files if they involve any JSX. This separation allows for better
organization and clarity in your TypeScript React projects.

In React, you cannot call hooks conditionally. This is a fundamental rule of hooks, which states that hooks must always be
called at the top level of a React function component or a custom hook. This ensures that the order of hook calls remains
consistent between renders, allowing React to correctly manage state and effects.

### **Key Points about Conditional Hook Usage**

1. **Rules of Hooks**:

   - Hooks cannot be called inside loops, conditions, or nested functions. They must be invoked unconditionally at the top
     level of your React component or custom hook [6][8].
   - This rule is in place to maintain the integrity of the component's state and lifecycle management.

2. **Workaround for Conditional Logic**:

   - While you cannot call hooks conditionally, you can implement conditional logic within the hook itself or use a pattern
     that allows you to manage when certain effects or behaviors occur based on state.
   - For example, you can always call the hook and then use internal logic to determine whether to execute specific
     functionality based on conditions:

   ```javascript
   const useConditionalEffect = (condition) => {
     useEffect(() => {
       if (condition) {
         // Perform some action
       }
     }, [condition]);
   };
   ```

3. **Using Custom Hooks**:

   - If you have multiple custom hooks and want to decide which one to use based on a condition, you can define both hooks at
     the top level and then conditionally use their returned values:

   ```javascript
   const useHookA = () => {
     /* ... */
   };
   const useHookB = () => {
     /* ... */
   };

   const MyComponent = ({ flag }) => {
     const data = flag ? useHookA() : useHookB();

     return <div>{data}</div>;
   };
   ```

4. **Example Scenario**:

   - If you want a custom hook to run only when a certain condition is met (e.g., a component is open), you can structure
     your hook to handle this internally rather than conditionally calling it:

   ```javascript
   const useTimeout = (isActive) => {
     useEffect(() => {
       if (!isActive) return;
       // Set up timeout logic here
     }, [isActive]);
   };

   const MyComponent = ({ isOpen }) => {
     useTimeout(isOpen);
     // Other component logic
   };
   ```

### **Conclusion**

In summary, while you cannot call hooks conditionally, you can design your custom hooks and components in such a way that
they handle conditional logic internally. This approach adheres to the rules of hooks while still allowing for dynamic
behavior based on component state or props.
