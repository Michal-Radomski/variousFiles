The main differences between Redux's `createStore` and Redux Toolkit's `configureStore` are:

- **Middleware**: `createStore` requires manual setup of middleware via `applyMiddleware`. `configureStore` automatically
  includes useful default middleware like immutable state and serializable checks, and allows easy customization of
  middleware[1][3][5].

- **DevTools**: `configureStore` has built-in support for Redux DevTools, enabling easier debugging. `createStore` requires
  manual setup for DevTools integration[1][3][5].

- **Setup and API**: `configureStore` provides a simpler, more modern API that accepts an options object with named fields
  (reducers, middleware, preloadedState, devTools), reducing boilerplate. `createStore` uses a more basic API and is now
  deprecated[2][5].

- **Use case**: Use `createStore` for minimal, basic Redux setups. Use `configureStore` for advanced features, better
  defaults, and easier customization, especially in modern Redux apps[1][3][5].

In summary, `configureStore` is the recommended, more powerful, and easier way to create a Redux store, while `createStore`
is the older, more manual method now deprecated[5].
