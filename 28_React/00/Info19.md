### Difference Between `renderToString` and `renderToStaticMarkup`

Both `renderToString` and `renderToStaticMarkup` are methods provided by React for server-side rendering, but they serve
different purposes:

1. **`renderToString`:**

   - Generates an HTML string with additional React-specific attributes (e.g., `data-reactroot`) embedded in the markup.
   - These attributes allow React to "hydrate" the markup on the client side, making it interactive by reusing the
     server-rendered DOM.
   - Use case: For interactive applications where the server-rendered HTML needs to be hydrated and made interactive on the
     client side[1][2].

2. **`renderToStaticMarkup`:**
   - Produces a plain HTML string without any React-specific attributes.
   - The output cannot be hydrated, meaning it is suitable for static, non-interactive pages such as emails or simple static
     sites.
   - Use case: When you need static HTML that does not require client-side interactivity[1][2][7].

### Comparison Table

| Feature                   | `renderToString`                         | `renderToStaticMarkup`       |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| React-specific attributes | Includes `data-reactroot` and others     | No React-specific attributes |
| Hydration support         | Supports hydration for interactivity     | Cannot be hydrated           |
| Output size               | Larger due to extra attributes           | Smaller, plain HTML          |
| Use case                  | Interactive apps (e.g., isomorphic apps) | Static sites, emails         |

### Examples

#### Example 1: Using `renderToString`

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { renderToString } from 'react-dom/server';

const App = () => Hello, this is an interactive React component!;
const html = renderToString();
console.log(html);
```

**Output:**

```html
Hello, this is an interactive React component!
```

#### Example 2: Using `renderToStaticMarkup`

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { renderToStaticMarkup } from 'react-dom/server';

const App = () => Hello, this is a static React component!;
const html = renderToStaticMarkup();
console.log(html);
```

**Output:**

```html
Hello, this is a static React component!
```

### Key Takeaway

Use `renderToString` for interactive apps requiring client-side hydration. Use `renderToStaticMarkup` for static content
where interactivity is unnecessary[1][2][7].
