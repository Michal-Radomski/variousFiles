The **Browser Object Model (BOM)** and the **Document Object Model (DOM)** are both essential concepts in web development,
but they serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics.

## Key Differences

### Definition

- **BOM**: The Browser Object Model refers to the set of objects provided by the browser that allow interaction with the
  browser itself, including properties and methods related to the browser window, history, location, and more. It encompasses
  everything that is accessible via scripting in the browser environment, starting with the global `window` object[1][4].
- **DOM**: The Document Object Model specifically pertains to the structure of HTML and XML documents. It represents the
  document as a tree of nodes, where each node corresponds to a part of the document (such as elements, attributes, and
  text). The DOM provides a standardized way to manipulate these document structures[1][3].

### Standardization

- **BOM**: There is no formal standard for BOM; it can vary across different browsers. This means that while some features
  may be common, there can be significant differences in how various browsers implement the BOM[2][4].
- **DOM**: The DOM is standardized by organizations like W3C, ensuring consistent behavior across different browsers. This
  standardization allows developers to rely on a uniform API for manipulating document structures regardless of the browser
  being used[1][3].

### Scope

- **BOM**: Includes a broader range of functionalities beyond just document manipulation. It allows access to
  browser-specific features such as window management, navigation, and history control. For example, it enables communication
  between different windows or tabs opened in a browser[2][4].
- **DOM**: Focuses solely on the content of documents (HTML or XML). It allows developers to create, modify, and delete
  elements within the document structure. For instance, it can be used to change text within an HTML element or add new
  elements dynamically[1][3].

### Examples

- **BOM**: Objects like `window`, `navigator`, `location`, and `history` are part of BOM. For example, `window.alert()`
  displays an alert dialog in the browser[1][2].
- **DOM**: Methods like `document.getElementById()` or `document.createElement()` are part of the DOM API used to interact
  with HTML elements directly[1][3].

In summary, while both BOM and DOM are integral to web development, BOM provides a broader interface for interacting with the
browser environment itself, whereas DOM focuses specifically on manipulating the content of web documents.
