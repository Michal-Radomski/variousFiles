The code snippet you provided is using `React.memo` to memoize a functional component in React. Here's a breakdown of what it
does:

```javascript
const Sun: React.MemoExoticComponent React.JSX.Element> = React.memo(() => {
  // Component code here
});
```

### Explanation:

- **`React.MemoExoticComponent`**: This is the type returned by `React.memo`. It indicates that the component is memoized,
  meaning it will only re-render if its props change.

- **`() => React.JSX.Element`**: This is the type of the component function being memoized. It's a function that takes no
  props (`()`) and returns a JSX element.

- **`React.memo`**: This is a Higher-Order Component (HOC) that wraps around a component to memoize it. It prevents
  unnecessary re-renders by checking if the props have changed. If they haven't, it skips rendering and reuses the last
  rendered result.

### How It Works:

1. **Memoization**: When you wrap a component with `React.memo`, React checks if the props have changed before deciding
   whether to re-render the component. If the props are the same, it skips re-rendering.

2. **Type Definition**: The type `React.MemoExoticComponent React.JSX.Element>` explicitly defines that `Sun` is a memoized
   component that returns JSX elements.

3. **Usage**: You can use `Sun` like any other React component, but it will only re-render if its props change. Since this
   component doesn't accept any props (`() => ...`), it will not re-render unless its internal state or context changes.

### Example:

```javascript
import React from 'react';

const Sun: React.MemoExoticComponent React.JSX.Element> = React.memo(() => {
  return Hello, Sun!;
});

export default Sun;
```

In this example, `Sun` will not re-render unless its internal state or context changes, because it doesn't accept any props.
