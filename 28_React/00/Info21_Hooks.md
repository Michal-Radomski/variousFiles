A React Hook is a special function that allows you to "hook into" React features such as state and lifecycle methods from
function components, which previously were only available in class components[1][2][4]. Introduced in React 16.8, Hooks
enable function components to manage state, perform side effects, access context, and reuse stateful logic across components,
making code simpler, more modular, and easier to maintain[1][3][5][6].

Key points about React Hooks:

- They let you use React state and lifecycle features without writing class components[1][2][4].
- Hooks are just functions but must follow specific rules: only call them inside React function components and always at the
  top level, not inside loops or conditions[3][4][6].
- Common built-in Hooks include `useState` for state management and `useEffect` for side effects like data fetching or
  subscriptions[1][4][6].
- You can create custom Hooks to encapsulate and reuse stateful logic across multiple components[4][6].
- Hooks simplify React development by avoiding the complexity of classes and making components more reusable and easier to
  understand[3][5][6].

In essence, React Hooks provide a powerful and flexible way to build React components by allowing function components to have
features that were once exclusive to class components, improving code clarity and reusability.
