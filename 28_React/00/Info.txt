In React, the order of method calls during the lifecycle of class and functional components varies significantly due to their inherent structures. Below is a detailed breakdown of the exact order of calls for both types of components.

## Class Components Lifecycle Order

1. **Constructor**: 
   - Called when the component is initialized.
   - Sets up initial state and binds methods.

2. **getDerivedStateFromProps**: 
   - Invoked right before rendering, both on the initial mount and on subsequent updates.
   - Allows state to be derived from props.

3. **Render**: 
   - The `render()` method is called to produce the component's output (JSX).
   - This method can be called multiple times during the component's lifecycle.

4. **componentDidMount**: 
   - Called once immediately after the component is mounted in the DOM.
   - Ideal for side effects like data fetching or subscriptions.

5. **Updating Phase (on state or prop changes)**:
   - **shouldComponentUpdate**: 
     - Invoked before rendering when new props or state are received.
     - Determines whether the component should update.
   - **getDerivedStateFromProps**: 
     - Called again if props change.
   - **Render**: 
     - Called again to re-render the component with updated state or props.
   - **componentDidUpdate**: 
     - Invoked immediately after updating occurs.
     - Useful for operations that need to happen after a re-render.

6. **Unmounting Phase**:
   - **componentWillUnmount**: 
     - Called immediately before a component is unmounted and destroyed.
     - Ideal for cleanup tasks like invalidating timers or canceling network requests.

## Functional Components Lifecycle Order

Functional components utilize hooks to achieve similar lifecycle behavior:

1. **Initial Render**:
   - The function body executes, producing the JSX output.

2. **useEffect (with empty dependency array)**:
   - If `useEffect` is used with an empty dependency array, it runs after the first render, similar to `componentDidMount`.

3. **Updating Phase (on state or prop changes)**:
   - The function body executes again on re-renders due to state or prop changes.
   - Each time it executes, it produces new JSX output.

4. **useEffect (with dependencies)**:
   - If dependencies are specified, `useEffect` runs after every render where those dependencies change, similar to `componentDidUpdate`.

5. **Cleanup Phase**:
   - If a cleanup function is returned from `useEffect`, it runs before the next effect execution and before unmounting, similar to `componentWillUnmount`.

### Summary Table

| Phase                  | Class Components Order                                    | Functional Components Order                     |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Mounting               | 1. Constructor<br>2. getDerivedStateFromProps<br>3. Render<br>4. componentDidMount | 1. Initial Render<br>2. useEffect (first run) |
| Updating               | 1. shouldComponentUpdate<br>2. getDerivedStateFromProps<br>3. Render<br>4. componentDidUpdate | 1. Function body (re-executes)<br>2. useEffect (on dependency change) |
| Unmounting             | 1. componentWillUnmount                                   | 1. Cleanup function from useEffect             |

Understanding these orders helps in managing side effects and optimizing performance in React applications effectively, whether using class-based or functional components with hooks [1][2][3][5].
