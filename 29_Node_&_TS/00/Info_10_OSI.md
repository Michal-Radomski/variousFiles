Web applications and Node.js applications primarily interact with the **Application Layer (Layer 7)** of the OSI model. This
layer is responsible for providing services and interfaces for applications to communicate over a network. It includes
protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, and others that are crucial for web applications and Node.js apps to function.

Here's a breakdown of how these applications relate to the OSI model:

- **Web Applications**: These typically use protocols such as HTTP or HTTPS to communicate with servers. They rely on the
  Application Layer to initiate requests and receive responses from web servers.

- **Node.js Applications**: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that can create networked applications. It uses
  TCP/IP protocols like TCP or UDP, which are part of the Transport Layer (Layer 4) in the OSI model. However, when
  interacting with web services or other networked applications, Node.js apps also rely on the Application Layer for
  protocols like HTTP.

In summary, while Node.js apps may use lower layers indirectly (e.g., Transport Layer for TCP/UDP), both web applications and
Node.js applications primarily interact with the Application Layer of the OSI model for network communication.

### Interaction with Other Layers

- **Presentation Layer (Layer 6)**: This layer is responsible for data encryption, compression, and translation. Web
  applications and Node.js apps indirectly benefit from these services when using secure protocols like HTTPS, which relies
  on encryption provided by this layer.
- **Session Layer (Layer 5)**: This layer manages sessions between applications. While not directly used by web or Node.js
  apps, it ensures that communication sessions are properly managed.

- **Lower Layers (Layers 1-4)**: These layers handle physical transmission, data framing, routing, and reliable data
  transfer. While not directly interacted with by web or Node.js applications, they are essential for the underlying network
  communication infrastructure.

### Summary Table

| Layer           | Function                         | Interaction with Web/Node.js Apps               |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| 7. Application  | High-level protocols (HTTP, FTP) | Direct interaction for network communication    |
| 6. Presentation | Data encryption, compression     | Indirectly used for secure protocols like HTTPS |
| 5. Session      | Session management               | Indirectly used for session management          |
| 4. Transport    | Reliable data transfer (TCP/UDP) | Indirectly used by Node.js for TCP/UDP          |
| 3. Network      | Routing and addressing           | Indirectly used for network routing             |
| 2. Data Link    | Frame transmission               | Indirectly used for data framing                |
| 1. Physical     | Bit transmission                 | Indirectly used for physical transmission       |

In summary, web applications and Node.js applications primarily interact with the Application Layer but indirectly rely on
services provided by other layers for complete network communication.

JavaScript with WebGL and GLSL does interact with the GPU, but this interaction does not occur at the **Physical Layer
(Layer 1)** of the OSI model. Instead, WebGL and GLSL operate at the **Application Layer (Layer 7)**, as they are part of the
high-level protocols and APIs that allow web applications to communicate with the GPU for rendering and computations.

Here's how it works:

- **WebGL**: This is a JavaScript API that allows web pages to use the GPU for rendering 3D and 2D graphics. It is based on
  OpenGL ES 2.0 and operates at the Application Layer, as it provides a high-level interface for interacting with the
  GPU[7][8].

- **GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language)**: This is used to write shaders that run on the GPU. Shaders are small programs that
  execute on the GPU to perform specific tasks like lighting and texture mapping. While GLSL interacts directly with the
  GPU's processing capabilities, this interaction is facilitated through WebGL, which is part of the Application Layer[7][8].

- **Physical Layer (Layer 1)**: This layer is responsible for the physical transmission of data between devices. It does not
  directly involve interactions with the GPU or any high-level programming languages like JavaScript or GLSL.

In summary, while JavaScript with WebGL and GLSL can leverage the GPU's capabilities, this interaction occurs at the
Application Layer of the OSI model, not the Physical Layer. The Physical Layer is concerned with the raw transmission of bits
over physical media, which is a much lower level of abstraction than what WebGL or GLSL operate on.
