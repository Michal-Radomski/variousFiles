To use a secret and an ISO time string to generate a key for Basic Authentication in both React (browser) and Node.js, you
can do the following:

### Core idea:

- Combine the secret and the ISO time string (e.g., from `new Date().toISOString()`) consistently.
- Create a hash (e.g., HMAC using SHA-256) of that combined string.
- Base64 encode the resulting hash.
- Use the Base64 encoded string as your Basic Auth token or part of the Basic Auth header.

### Why Basic Auth?

Basic Auth requires a base64 encoded string of `username:password`. You can generate the "password" using the
secret+time-based key, or if the secret is used as the username, the key can be the password.

## In Node.js

Using the built-in `crypto` module, you can generate a time-dependent key and prepare a Basic Auth header as follows:

```js
const crypto = require("crypto");

function generateBasicAuthHeader(secret) {
  const gmtString = new Date().toISOString();
  const combined = secret + gmtString;

  // Create HMAC SHA-256 hash of secret + time string
  const hmac = crypto.createHmac("sha256", secret);
  hmac.update(gmtString);
  const hash = hmac.digest(); // Buffer

  // Base64 encode in the form username:password (you can use secret as username)
  const basicAuthString = Buffer.from(`${secret}:${hash.toString("hex")}`).toString("base64");

  return `Basic ${basicAuthString}`;
}

// Example usage:
const secret = "mysecret";
console.log(generateBasicAuthHeader(secret));
```

This produces a Basic Auth header string such as `Basic bXlzZWNyZXQ6abcdef1234...` where the password part is derived from
your secret + the current GMT time[previous conversation].[1]

## In React (Browser)

In React or any browser environment, since `crypto` is different, you use the Web Crypto API to generate the HMAC and then
create the Basic Auth header similarly:

```js
async function generateBasicAuthHeader(secret) {
  const encoder = new TextEncoder();
  const gmtString = new Date().toISOString();

  // Import crypto key based on your secret
  const key = await window.crypto.subtle.importKey("raw", encoder.encode(secret), { name: "HMAC", hash: "SHA-256" }, false, [
    "sign",
  ]);

  // Sign the GMT string to get HMAC
  const signature = await window.crypto.subtle.sign("HMAC", key, encoder.encode(gmtString));

  // Convert signature to hex
  const hashArray = new Uint8Array(signature);
  const hashHex = Array.from(hashArray)
    .map((b) => b.toString(16).padStart(2, "0"))
    .join("");

  // Encode secret:hashHex to Base64
  const basicAuthString = btoa(`${secret}:${hashHex}`);

  return `Basic ${basicAuthString}`;
}

// Usage (React/async context)
const secret = "mysecret";
generateBasicAuthHeader(secret).then((header) => console.log(header));
```

This will create a base64 string representing your Basic Auth header with the password derived from the secret and current
ISO time[previous conversation].[2][1]

### Important Notes:

- You may want to truncate or round the ISO time (e.g., to the hour) for key stability during a time window.
- Basic Auth sends credentials in base64 that can be decoded easily â€” ensure usage over HTTPS.
- This approach ensures your "password" is different for every time period, based on secret + time.
- To authenticate on your backend, replicate the key-generation logic to verify the incoming Basic Auth token.
- If integrating this with API calls, set the HTTP header `Authorization` to the generated string.

This approach provides a consistent formula to generate a key based on secret and GMT time usable as a Basic Auth credential
in both Node.js and React environments.
